# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Churn Analysis Pipeline** using **SQL Server, Power BI, and Python**.  
It covers ETL, data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning with Random Forest, integrating results back into Power BI for actionable insights.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **SQL Server ETL & Cleaning**
   - Run `Customer Churn Analysis.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - This script loads raw churn data, performs cleaning, and prepares a machine-learning-ready dataset.

2. **Machine Learning in Python**
   - Open `Customer Churn prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Train a Random Forest model on the cleaned dataset.
   - Export predictions (e.g., `predicted_churn.csv`).

3. **Power BI Visualization**
   - Open `Customer Churn Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
   - Use cleaned data and predicted churn output.
   - Visualize churn KPIs, risk profiles, and customer segments.
